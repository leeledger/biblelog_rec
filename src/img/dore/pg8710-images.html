      This volume, as its title indicates, is a collection of engravings
      illustrative of the Bible—the designs being all from the pencil of
      the greatest of modern delineators, Gustave Dore. The original work, from
      which this collection has been made, met with an immediate and warm
      recognition and acceptance among those whose means admitted of its
      purchase, and its popularity has in no wise diminished since its first
      publication, but has even extended to those who could only enjoy it
      casually, or in fragmentary parts. That work, however, in its entirety,
      was far too costly for the larger and ever-widening circle of M. Dore's
      admirers, and to meet the felt and often-expressed want of this class, and
      to provide a volume of choice and valuable designs upon sacred subjects
      for art-loving Biblical students generally, this work was projected and
      has been carried forward. The aim has been to introduce subjects of
      general interest—that is, those relating to the most prominent
      events and personages of Scripture—those most familiar to all
      readers; the plates being chosen with special reference to the known taste
      of the American people. To each cut is prefixed a page of letter-press—in,
      narrative form, and containing generally a brief analysis of the design.
      Aside from the labors of the editor and publishers, the work, while in
      progress, was under the pains-taking and careful scrutiny of artists and
      scholars not directly interested in the undertaking, but still having a
      generous solicitude for its success. It is hoped, therefore, that its
      general plan and execution will render it acceptable both to the
      appreciative and friendly patrons of the great artist, and to those who
      would wish to possess such a work solely as a choice collection of
      illustrations upon sacred themes.

<h2>
      GUSTAVE DORE.
    </h2>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
      The subject of this sketch is, perhaps, the most original and variously
      gifted designer the world has ever known. At an age when most men have
      scarcely passed their novitiate in art, and are still under the direction
      and discipline of their masters and the schools, he had won a brilliant
      reputation, and readers and scholars everywhere were gazing on his work
      with ever-increasing wonder and delight at his fine fancy and multifarious
      gifts. He has raised illustrative art to a dignity and importance before
      unknown, and has developed capacities for the pencil before unsuspected.
      He has laid all subjects tribute to his genius, explored and embellished
      fields hitherto lying waste, and opened new and shining paths and vistas
      where none before had trod. To the works of the great he has added the
      lustre of his genius, bringing their beauties into clearer view and
      warming them to a fuller life.
    </p>
<p>
      His delineations of character, in the different phases of life, from the
      horrible to the grotesque, the grand to the comic, attest the versatility
      of his powers; and, whatever faults may be found by critics, the public
      will heartily render their quota of admiration to his magic touch, his
      rich and facile rendering of almost every thought that stirs, or lies yet
      dormant, in the human heart. It is useless to attempt a sketch of his
      various beauties; those who would know them best must seek them in the
      treasure—house that his genius is constantly augmenting with fresh
      gems and wealth. To one, however, of his most prominent traits we will
      refer—his wonderful rendering of the powers of Nature.
    </p>
<p>
      His early wanderings in the wild and romantic passes of the Vosges
      doubtless developed this inherent tendency of his mind. There he wandered,
      and there, mayhap, imbibed that deep delight of wood and valley, mountain—pass
      and rich ravine, whose variety of form and detail seems endless to the
      enchanted eye. He has caught the very spell of the wilderness; she has
      laid her hand upon him, and he has gone forth with her blessing. So bold
      and truthful and minute are his countless representations of forest
      scenery; so delicate the tracery of branch and stem; so patriarchal the
      giant boles of his woodland monarchs, that the' gazer is at once satisfied
      and entranced. His vistas lie slumbering with repose either in shadowy
      glade or fell ravine, either with glint of lake or the glad, long course
      of some rejoicing stream, and above all, supreme in a beauty all its own,
      he spreads a canopy of peerless sky, or a wilderness, perhaps, of angry
      storm, or peaceful stretches of soft, fleecy cloud, or heavens serene and
      fair—another kingdom to his teeming art, after the earth has
      rendered all her gifts.
    </p>
<p>
      Paul Gustave Dore was born in the city of Strasburg, January 10, 1833. Of
      his boyhood we have no very particular account. At eleven years of age,
      however, he essayed his first artistic creation—a set' of
      lithographs, published in his native city. The following year found him in
      Paris, entered as a 7. student at the Charlemagne Lyceum. His first actual
      work began in 1848, when his fine series of sketches, the "Labors of
      Hercules," was given to the public through the medium of an illustrated,
      journal with which he was for a long time connected as designer. In 1856
      were published the illustrations for Balzac's "Contes Drolatiques" and
      those for "The Wandering Jew "—the first humorous and grotesque in
      the highest degree—indeed, showing a perfect abandonment to fancy;
      the other weird and supernatural, with fierce battles, shipwrecks,
      turbulent mobs, and nature in her most forbidding and terrible aspects.
      Every incident or suggestion that could possibly make the story more
      effective, or add to the horror of the scenes was seized upon and
      portrayed with wonderful power. These at once gave the young designer a
      great reputation, which was still more enhanced by his subsequent works.
    </p>
<p>
      With all his love for nature and his power of interpreting her in her
      varying moods, Dore was a dreamer, and many of his finest achievements
      were in the realm of the imagination. But he was at home in the actual
      world also, as witness his designs for "Atala," "London—a
      Pilgrimage," and many of the scenes in "Don Quixote."
    </p>
<p>
      When account is taken of the variety of his designs, and the fact
      considered that in almost every task he attempted none had ventured before
      him, the amount of work he accomplished is fairly incredible. To enumerate
      the immense tasks he undertook—some single volumes alone containing
      hundreds of illustrations—will give some faint idea of his industry.
      Besides those already mentioned are Montaigne, Dante, the Bible, Milton,
      Rabelais, Tennyson's "Idyls of the King," "The Ancient Mariner,"
      Shakespeare, "Legende de Croquemitaine," La Fontaine's "Fables," and
      others still.
    </p>
<p>
      Take one of these works—the Dante, La Fontaine, or "Don Quixote"—and
      glance at the pictures. The mere hand labor involved in their production
      is surprising; but when the quality of the work is properly estimated,
      what he accomplished seems prodigious. No particular mention need be made
      of him as painter or sculptor, for his reputation rests solely upon his
      work as an illustrator.
    </p>
<p>
      Dore's nature was exuberant and buoyant, and he was youthful in
      appearance. He had a passion for music, possessed rare skill as a
      violinist, and it is assumed that, had he failed to succeed with his
      pencil, he could have won a brilliant reputation as a musician.
    </p>
<p>
      He was a bachelor, and lived a quiet, retired life with his mother—married,
      as he expressed it, to her and his art. His death occurred on January 23,
      1883.

      "And the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be alone; I
      will make him a helpmeet for him. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
      fall on Adam, and he slept, and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the
      flesh instead thereof; and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man,
      made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, This is now
      bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because
      she was taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and
      mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh."
      Genesis ii, 18, 21-24.
    </p>
<p>
      In these few words the Scriptures narrate the creation of the first mother
      of our race. In "Paradise Lost," the poetic genius of Milton, going more
      into detail, describes how Eve awoke to consciousness, and found herself
      reposing under a shade of flowers, much wondering what she was and whence
      she came. Wandering by the margin of a small lake, she sees her own form
      mirrored in the clear waters, at which she wonders more. But a voice is
      heard, leading her to him for whom she was made, who lies sleeping under a
      grateful shade. It is at this point the artist comes to interpret the
      poet's dream. Amid the varied and luxurious foliage of Eden, in the vague
      light of the early dawn, Eve is presented, coy and graceful, gazing on her
      sleeping Lord, while in the background is faintly outlined the mystic form
      of Him in whose image they were created.

      And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know
      good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the
      tree of life, and eat, and live forever: Therefore, the Lord God sent him
      forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was
      taken. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of
      Eden cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the
      way of the tree of life.—Genesis iii, 22-24
    </p>
<p>
      They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld Of Paradise, so late their

      rest, and Providence their guide; They, hand in hand, with wandering steps
      and slow, Through Eden took their solitary way.

      And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I
      have gotten a man from the Lord. And she again bare his brother Abel. And
      Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. And in
      process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the
      ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he also brought of the
      firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect
      unto Abel and to his offering: But unto Cain and to his offering he had
      not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the
      Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance
      fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest
      not well, sin lieth at the door, and unto thee shall be his desire, and
      thou shalt rule over him. And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it
      came to pass,—when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against
      Abel his brother, and slew him.
    </p>
<p>
      And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I
      know not Am I my brother's keeper? And he said, What hast thou done? the
      voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now art
      thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy
      brother's blood from thy hand; When thou tillest the ground, it shall not
      henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt
      thou be in the earth. And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is
      greater than I can bear. Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the
      face of the earth and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a
      fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that
      every one that findeth me shall slay me. And the Lord said unto him,
      Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him
      sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should
      kill him.
    </p>
<p>
      And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of
      Nod, on the east of Eden.—Genesis iv, 1-16

      In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
      seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the
      great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. And the rain
      was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
    </p>
<p>
      In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons
      of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into
      the ark; they, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after
      their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after
      his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. And
      they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is
      the breath of life. And they that went in, went in male and female of all
      flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in.
    </p>
<p>
      And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and
      bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. And the waters
      prevailed, and were increased, greatly upon the earth; and the ark went
      upon the face of the waters. And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the
      earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were
      covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains
      were covered. And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,
      and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth
      upon the earth, and every man; all in whose nostrils was the breath of
      life, of all that was in the dry land, died. And every living substance
      was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle,
      and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were
      destroyed from the earth; and Noah only remained alive, and they that were
      with him in the ark.

      And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: And he

      And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told
      his two brethren without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it
      upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of
      their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their
      father's nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his

      And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

<p>
      And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a
      plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And they said one to
      another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had
      brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. And they said, Go to, let
      us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let
      us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole
      earth.
    </p>
<p>
      And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of
      men builded. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have
      all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be
      restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go
      down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one
      another's speech.
    </p>
<p>
      So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the
      earth: and they left off to build the city.

      Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there
      confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord
      scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.—Genesis xi, 1-9.

      In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. And all

      stranger, were circumcised with him.

      tent door in the heat of the day; and he lift up his eyes and looked, and,
      lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from
      the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, and said, My Lord, if
      now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy
      servant: let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet,
      and rest yourselves under the tree: And I will fetch a morsel of bread,

      ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
    </p>
<p>
      And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready
      quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the
      hearth. And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good,

      And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise,

      consumed in the iniquity of the city. And while he lingered, the men laid
      hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of
      his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him
      forth, and set him without the city.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he
      said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all
      the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. And Lot said
      unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord. Behold now, thy servant hath found grace
      in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed
      unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some
      evil take me and I die. Behold now this city is near to flee unto, and it
      is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither (is it not a little one?) and
      my soul shall live. And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee
      concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the
      which thou hast spoken. Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do
      anything till thou be come thither.

      Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

      And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as

      at the set time of which God had spoken to him. And Abraham called the
      name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. And
      Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had
      commanded him. And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac
      was born unto him.
    </p>
<p>
      And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will
      laugh with me. And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah
      should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.
      And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the
      same day that Isaac was weaned.

<p>
      And Sarah, saw the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, which she had born unto
      Abraham, mocking. Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman
      and her son; for the son of this, bondwoman shall not be heir with my son,
      even with Isaac.
    </p>
<p>
      And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. And
      God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the
      lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee,
      hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. And also of
      the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.

      And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of

      And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of
      water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child,
      and sent her away; and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of
      Beer-sheba. And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
      under one of the shrubs. And she went and sat her down over against him a
      good way off, as it were a bow-shot: for she said, Let me not see the
      death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice
      and wept. And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called
      to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear
      not, for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. Arise, lift up
      the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
      And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and
      filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. And God was with the
      lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. And
      he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of
      the land of Egypt.—Genesis xxi. 14-21.

      And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and
      said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. And he said, Take
      now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the
      land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the
      mountains which I will tell thee of.
    </p>
<p>
      And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took
      two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for
      the burnt offering, and rose up and went unto the place of which God had
      told him. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
      place afar off. And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with
      the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to
      you. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon
      Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand and a knife, and they went
      both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said,
      My father: and he, said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire
      and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? And Abraham
      said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so
      they went both of them together. And they came to the place which God had
      told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order,
      and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And
      Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. And
      the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham,
      Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the
      lad, neither do thou anything unto him: for now I know that thou fearest
      God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. And
      Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught
      in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered
      him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
    </p>
<p>
      And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is to this
      day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
    </p>
<p>
      And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second
      time, and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou
      hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, that
      in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed
      as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and
      thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all
      the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.—Geneszs
      xxii. 1-18.

      And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the
      years of the life of Sarah. And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is
      Hebron in the land of Canaan and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to
      weep for her.
    </p>
<p>
      And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of
      Heth, saying, I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a
      possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my
      sight.
    </p>
<p>
      And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, Hear us, my
      lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres
      bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that
      thou mayest bury thy dead.
    </p>
<p>
      And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to
      the children of Heth. And he communed with them, saying, If it be your
      mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for
      me to Ephron the son of Zohar, that he may give me the cave of Machpelah,
      which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it
      is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a burying-place amongst
      you.
    </p>
<p>
      And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite
      answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that
      went in at the gate of his city, saying, Nay, my lord, hear me: the field
      give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence
      of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
    </p>
<p>
      And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. And he spake
      unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou
      wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field;
      take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
    </p>
<p>
      And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, My lord, hearken unto me:
      the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver: what is that betwixt me
      and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
    </p>
<p>
      And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the
      silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four
      hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
    </p>
<p>
      And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre,
      the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in
      the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure unto
      Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before
      all that went in at the gate of his city.
    </p>
<p>
      And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of
      Machpelah before Mamre; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. And the
      field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a
      possession of a burying-place by the sons of Heth.—Genesis xxiii.

      And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and
      sware to him concerning that matter.
    </p>
<p>
      And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed;
      for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose and went to
      Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. And he made his camels to kneel down,
      without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the
      time that women go out to draw water. And he said, O Lord God of my master
      Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto
      my master Abraham. Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the
      daughters of the men of the city come out to draw: water: and let it come
      to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray
      thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy
      camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy
      servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness
      unto my master.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah
      came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor,
      Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. And the damsel was
      very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she
      went down to the well, and filled her pitcher and came up. And the servant
      ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of
      thy pitcher. And she said, Drink, my lord; and she hasted, and let down
      her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. And when she had done
      giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until
      they have done drinking. And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the
      trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his
      camels.
    </p>
<p>
      And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Lord had
      made his journey prosperous or not.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a
      golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of
      ten shekels weight of gold: and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I
      pray thee; is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in? And she
      said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she
      bare unto Nahor. She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and
      provender enough, and room to lodge in.
    </p>
<p>
      And the man bowed down his head and worshiped the Lord. And he said,
      Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute

      to the house of my master's brethren.

      And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so
      that he could not see, he called Esau, his eldest son, and said unto him,
      My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. And he said, Behold now,
      I am old, I know not the day of my death: Now therefore take, I pray thee,
      thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me
      some venison; And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to
      me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
    </p>
<p>
      And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the
      field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
    </p>
<p>
      And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father
      speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, Bring me venison, and make me savoury
      meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the Lord before my death. Now
      therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
      Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats;
      and I will make them savoury meat for thy father such as he loveth; And
      thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless
      thee before his death.
    </p>
<p>
      And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy
      man, and I am a smooth man: My father peradventure will feel me, and I
      shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and
      not a blessing.
    </p>
<p>
      And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my
      voice, and go fetch me them.
    </p>
<p>
      And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother
      made savoury meat, such as his father loved. And Rebekah took goodly
      raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put
      them upon Jacob her younger son: And she put the skins of the kids of the
      goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck: And she gave the
      savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her
      son Jacob.
    </p>
<p>
      And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I;
      who art thou, my son? And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first
      born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and
      eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. And Isaac said unto his
      son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said,
      Because the Lord thy God brought it to me. And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come
      near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very
      son Esau or not. And Jacob went; near unto Isaac his father; and he felt
      him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of
      Esau. And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
      brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.
    </p>
<p>
      And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. And he said,
      Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may
      bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat; and he brought
      him wine, and he drank. And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now,
      and kiss me, my son. And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the
      smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son
      is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed: Therefore God give
      thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of
      corn and wine: Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be
      lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed
      be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.—Genesis

      And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for

      Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother,
      that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and
      watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. And Jacob kissed Rachel,
      and lifted up his voice, and wept. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her
      father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her
      father.

      And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's

      brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for naught? tell me, what shall
      thy wages be?
    </p>
<p>
      And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name
      of the younger was Rachel. Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful
      and well favoured.
    </p>
<p>
      And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel
      thy younger daughter. And Laban said, It is better that I give her to
      thee, than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.
    </p>
<p>
      And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a
      few days, for the love he had for her. And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me
      my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
    </p>
<p>
      And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
      And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and
      brought her to him; and he went in unto her. And Laban gave unto his
      daughter Leah Zilpah his maid, for an handmaid. And it came to pass that
      in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this
      thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore
      then hast thou beguiled me? And Laban said, It must not be so done in our
      country, to give the younger before the firstborn. Fulfil her week, and we
      will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me
      yet seven other years.

<p>
      And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week; and he gave him Rachel his
      daughter to wife also. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his

      also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.—Genesis

      These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was
      feeding the flock with his brethren, and the lad was with the sons of
      Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph brought
      unto his father their evil report. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all
      his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a
      coat of many colors. And when his brethren saw that their father loved him
      more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably
      unto him.
    </p>
<p>
      And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated
      him yet the more. And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream
      which I have dreamed. For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field,
      and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves
      stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. And his brethren said
      to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have
      dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for
      his words.
    </p>
<p>
      And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said,
      Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and
      the eleven stars made obeisance to me. And he told it to his father and to
      his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this
      dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren
      indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth. And his brethren
      envied him; but his father observed the saying.
    </p>
<p>
      And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
    </p>
<p>
      And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. And when
      they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired
      against him to slay him. And they said one to another, Behold, this
      dreamer cometh. Come now, therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him
      into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him; and we
      shall see what will become of his dreams. And Reuben heard it, and he
      delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. And
      Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is
      in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of
      their hands to deliver him to his father again.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they
      stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him;
      and they took him and cast him into a pit; and the pit was empty, there
      was no water in it. And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up
      their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from
      Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to
      carry it down to Egypt. And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is

      him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our
      brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.

      Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up
      Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty
      pieces of silver; and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
    </p>
<p>
      And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of
      Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.—Genesis xxxvii, 2—12,

      And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed:
      and, behold, he stood by the river. And, behold, there came up out of the
      river seven well favoured kine and fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
      And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill
      favoured and lean-fleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of
      the river. And the ill favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven
      well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
    </p>
<p>
      And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn
      came up upon one stalk, rank and good. And, behold, seven thin ears and
      blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. And the seven thin ears
      devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it
      was a dream.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he
      sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
      thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could
      interpret them unto Pharaoh.
    </p>
<p>
      [At the suggestion of his chief butler Pharaoh sends for Joseph and
      relates to him his dreams, which Joseph interprets as follows:]
    </p>
<p>
      And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed
      Pharaoh what he is about to do. The seven good kine are seven years; and
      the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. And the seven thin
      and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the
      seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of
      famine. This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is
      about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. Behold, there come seven years of
      great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: And there shall arise after
      them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the
      land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; and the plenty shall
      not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall
      be very grievous. And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice it
      is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it
      to pass.
    </p>
<p>
      Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him
      over the land of Egypt. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers
      over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the
      seven plenteous years. And let them gather all the food of those good
      years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them
      keep food in the cities. And that food shall be for store to the land
      against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt;
      that the land perish not through the famine.—Genesis xli. 1-36.

      Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him;
      and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man
      with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. And he wept
      aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
    </p>
<p>
      And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live?
      And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his
      presence. And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.
      And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold
      into Egypt. Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that
      ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. For
      these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five
      years, in which there shall neither be earing nor harvest. And God sent me
      before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your
      lives by a great deliverance. So now it was not you that sent me hither,
      but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his
      house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. Haste ye, and go up
      to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made
      me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: And thou shalt dwell
      in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy
      children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and
      all that thou hast. And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five
      years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast,
      come to poverty. And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother
      Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. And ye shall tell my
      father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye
      shall haste and bring down my father hither.
    </p>
<p>
      And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept
      upon his neck. Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them:
      and after that his brethren talked with him.
    </p>
<p>
      And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's
      brethren are come and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
    </p>
<p>
      And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your
      beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; and take your father and
      your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the
      land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.—Genesis xlv,
      1-18.

      And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of
      Levi. And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that
      he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. And when she could not
      longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with
      slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the
      flags by the river's brink. And his sister stood afar off, to wit what
      would be done to him.
    </p>
<p>
      And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and
      her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark
      among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. And when she had opened
      it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion
      on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. Then said his
      sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the
      Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? And Pharaoh's
      daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
      And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it

      Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king
      of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon,
      gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and
      encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
    </p>
<p>
      And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying,
      Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us
      and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains
      are gathered together against us.
    </p>
<p>
      So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him,
      and all the mighty men of valor. And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear them
      not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of
      them stand before thee. Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went
      up from Gilgal all night. And the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and
      slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way
      that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.
      And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the
      going down to Beth-horon, that the Lord cast down great stones from heaven
      upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with
      hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
    </p>
<p>
      Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the
      Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of
      Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley
      of Ajalon. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
      had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book
      of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hastened not
      to go down about a whole day. And there was no day like that before it or
      after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord
      fought for Israel.
    </p>
<p>
      And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. But
      these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah. And it
      was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at
      Makkedah. And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
      and set men by it for to keep them: and stay ye not, but pursue after your
      enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into
      their cities; for the Lord your God hath delivered them into your hand.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an
      end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed,
      that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities. Joshua x,
      5-20.

      Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab, the
      father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched
      his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.
    </p>
<p>
      And they shewed Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, was gone up to
      Mount Tabor. And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine
      hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from
      Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
    </p>
<p>
      And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the Lord
      hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the Lord gone out before
      thee? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
    </p>
<p>
      And the Lord discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots and all his host,
      with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off
      his chariot, and fled away on his feet. But Barak pursued after the
      chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the
      host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man
      left.
    </p>
<p>
      Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael, the wife of
      Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and
      the house of Heber the Kenite. And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said
      unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had
      turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle. And he
      said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am
      thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered
      him. Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall
      be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man
      here? that thou shalt say, No. Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a nail of the
      tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote
      the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was
      fast asleep and weary. So he died.
    </p>
<p>
      And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said
      unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when
      he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his
      temples. Judges iv, 2-22.

      offered themselves. Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I,

      Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, When thou marchedst out of the field
      of Edom, The earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also
      dropped water. The mountains melted from before the Lord, Even that Sinai

      milk; She brought forth butter in a lordly dish. She put her hand to the
      nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; And with the hammer she
      smote Sisera, She smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken
      through his temples. At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: At her
      feet he bowed, he fell: Where he bowed, there he fell down dead. The
      mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice,
      Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the wheels of his
      chariots? Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to

      he passed over unto the children of Ammon.

      And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great
      strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee. And
      Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were
      never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. Then the lords
      of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been
      dried, and she bound him with them. Now there were men lying in wait,
      abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be
      upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken
      when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
    </p>
<p>
      And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me
      lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he
      said unto her, If they bind me fast with clew ropes that never were
      occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. Delilah therefore
      took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The
      Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in
      the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.
    </p>
<p>
      And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me
      lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If
      thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. And she fastened it
      with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And
      he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam and
      with the web.
    </p>
<p>
      And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart
      is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told
      me wherein thy great strength lieth. And it came to pass, when she pressed
      him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto
      death; that he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not
      come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my
      mother's womb if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I
      shall become weak, and be like any other man.
    </p>
<p>
      And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and
      called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he
      hath showed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up
      unto her, and brought money in their hand. And she made him sleep upon her
      knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven
      locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went
      from him. And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke
      out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and
      shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him. Judges
      xvi, 4-20.

      But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down
      to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the
      prison house.
    </p>
<p>
      Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a
      great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our
      God hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. And when the people saw
      him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into
      our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of
      us. And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said,
      Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out
      of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the
      pillars. And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me
      that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean
      upon them. Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of
      the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three
      thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
    </p>
<p>
      And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray
      thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be
      at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. And Samson took hold
      of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was
      borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.
      And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself
      with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the
      people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more
      than they which he slew in his life.
    </p>
<p>
      Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him,
      and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the
      burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.—Judges

<p>
      Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a
      famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn
      in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. And the name
      of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of
      his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they
      came into the country of Moab, and continued there. And Elimelech Naomi's
      husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. And they took them wives
      of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the
      other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years. And Mahlon and Chilion
      died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her
      husband.
    </p>
<p>
      Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the
      country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord
      had visited his people in giving them bread. Wherefore she went forth out
      of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and
      they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
    </p>
<p>
      And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her
      mother's house the Lord deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the
      dead, and with me. The Lord grant you that ye may find rest, each of you
      in the house of her husband.
    </p>
<p>
      Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. And they
      said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.
    </p>
<p>
      And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are
      there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? Turn
      again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I
      should say, I have hope, if I should have a husband also to night, and
      should also bear sons; would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would
      ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth
      me much for your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.
    </p>
<p>
      And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her
      mother in law but Ruth cleave unto her.
    </p>
<p>
      And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and
      unto her gods return thou after thy sister in law.
    </p>
<p>
      And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following
      after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I
      will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: Where thou
      diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and
      more also, if ought but death part thee and me.
    </p>
<p>
      When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left
      speaking unto her.

<p>
      So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem.—Ruth i, 1-19.

</p>
<p>
      And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the
      family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.
    </p>
<p>
      And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and
      glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she
      said unto her, Go, my daughter. And she went, and came and gleaned in the
      field after the reapers; and her hap was to light on a part of the field
      belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
    </p>
<p>
      And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The Lord
      be with you. And they answered him, The Lord bless thee. Then said Boaz
      unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? And
      the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the
      Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: and
      she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the
      sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now,
      that she tarried a little in the house.
    </p>
<p>
      Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean
      in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my
      maidens: let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou
      after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch
      thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that
      which the young men have drawn.
    </p>
<p>
      Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto
      him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take
      knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?
    </p>
<p>
      And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all
      that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine
      husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of
      thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not
      heretofore. The Lord recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee
      of the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.
    </p>
<p>
      Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast
      comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid,
      though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.
    </p>
<p>
      And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the
      bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers:
      and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and
      left. And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men,
      saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not: and
      let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them,
      that she may glean them and rebuke her not.
    </p>
<p>
      So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned:
      and it was about an ephah of barley.—Ruth ii. 1-17,

      THE RETURN OF THE ARK.

<p>
      And the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven
      months. And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
      saying, What shall we do to the ark of the Lord? tell us wherewith we
      shall send it to his place. And they said, If ye send away the ark of the
      God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass
      offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his
      hand is not removed from you. Then said they, What shall be the trespass
      offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods,
      and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the
      Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords. Wherefore
      ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the
      land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will
      lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your
      land. Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
      Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them,
      did they not let the people go, and they departed? Now therefore make a
      new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and
      tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them: and take
      the ark of the Lord, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold,
      which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side
      thereof; and send it away, that it may go. And see, if it goeth up by the
      way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great
      evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote
      us; it was a chance that happened to us.
    </p>
<p>
      And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart,
      and shut up their calves at home: and they laid the ark of the Lord upon
      the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their
      emerods. And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh,
      and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to
      the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after
      them, unto the border of Beth-shemesh. And they of Beth-shemesh were
      reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes,
      and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it. And the cart came into the field
      of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone:
      and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering
      unto the Lord.
    </p>
<p>
      And the Levites took down the ark of the Lord, and the coffer that was
      with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone:
      and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed
      sacrifices the same day unto the Lord.—1 Samuel vi, 1-5.

      And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that
      the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved
      him as his own soul. And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no
      more home to his father's house.
    </p>
<p>
      Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own
      soul. And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and
      gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and
      to his girdle.
    </p>
<p>
      And David went out withersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely:
      and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of
      all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the
      slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of
      Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy,
      and with instruments of music. And the women answered one another as they
      played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten
      thousands.
    </p>
<p>
      And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, "They
      have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but
      thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?" And Saul eyed David
      from that day and forward.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon
      Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with
      his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand. And
      Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall
      with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.—1 Samuel

<p>
      And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
      Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the
      wilderness of Engedi. Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all
      Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild
      goats. And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and
      Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the
      sides of the cave.
    </p>
<p>
      And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord said
      unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou
      mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and
      cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily. And it came to pass afterward,
      that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. And he
      said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my
      master, the Lord's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him,
      seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.
    </p>
<p>
      So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to
      rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.
      David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after
      Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David
      stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself.
    </p>
<p>
      And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying,
      Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how
      that the Lord had delivered thee to-day into mine hand in the cave: and
      some bade me kill thee; but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not
      put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the Lord's anointed.
      Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for
      in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou
      and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I
      have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it. The
      Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord avenge me of thee: but mine
      hand shall not be upon thee. As saith the proverb of the ancients,
      Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon
      thee. After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou
      pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. The Lord therefore be judge, and
      judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out
      of thine hand.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words
      unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul
      lifted up his voice, and wept. And he said to David, Thou art more
      righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded
      thee evil. And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well,
      with me: forasmuch as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand, thou
      killedst me not. For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well
      away? wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me
      this day. And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and
      that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. Swear now
      therefore unto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after
      me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.
    </p>
<p>
      And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat
      them up unto the hold.—2 Samuel xxiv, 2—22.

      slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchshua, Saul's sons.
    </p>
<p>
      And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was
      sore wounded of the archers. Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw
      thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come
      and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for
      he was sore afraid. Therefore, Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. And
      when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his
      sword, and died with him.
    </p>
<p>
      So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men,
      that same day together.
    </p>
<p>
      And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and
      they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled,
      and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled;
      and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. And it came to pass on the
      morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul
      and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa. And they cut off his head, and
      stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round
      about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.
      And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth and they fastened his
      body to the wall of Beth-shan.
    </p>
<p>
      And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the
      Philistines had done to Saul; all the valiant men arose, and went all
      night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall
      of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. And they took
      their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven
      days. 1 Samuel xxxi.

<p>
      And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of
      thousands and captains of hundreds over them. And David set forth a third
      part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand
      of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the
      hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will
      surely go forth with you myself also.
    </p>
<p>
      But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away,
      they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for
      us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better
      that thou succor us out of the city.
    </p>
<p>
      And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king
      stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by
      thousands. And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
      gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the
      people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning
      Absalom.
    </p>
<p>
      So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was
      in the wood of Ephraim; where the people of Israel were slain before the
      servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day, of
      twenty thousand men. For the battle was there scattered over the face of
      all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword
      devoured.
    </p>
<p>
      And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and
      the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught
      hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and
      the mule that was under him went away.
    </p>
<p>
      And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold I saw Absalom
      hanged in an oak.
    </p>
<p>
      And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him,
      and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have
      given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.
    </p>
<p>
      And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of
      silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the
      king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and
      Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. Otherwise I
      should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no
      matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldst have set thyself
      against me.
    </p>
<p>
      Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in
      his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet
      alive in the midst of the oak. And ten young men that bare Joab's armor
      compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. And Joab blew the
      trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held
      back the people. And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in
      the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel
      fled every one to his tent.—2 Samuel xviii, 1-17.

      Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king
      tidings, how that the Lord hath avenged him of his enemies. And Joab said
      unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear
      tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the
      king's son is dead. Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou
      hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran. Then said Ahimaaz
      the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee,
      also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son,
      seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? But howsoever, said he let me run.
      And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and
      overran Cushi.
    </p>
<p>
      And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof
      over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and
      behold a man running alone. And the watchman cried, and told the king. And
      the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came
      apace, and drew near. And the watchman saw another man running: and the
      watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running
      alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. And the watchman said,
      Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the
      son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good
      tidings.
    </p>
<p>
      And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down
      to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the Lord
      thy God, which hath delivereth up the men that lifted up their hand
      against my lord the king. And the king said, Is the young man Absalom
      safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy
      servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was. And the king
      said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood
      still.
    </p>
<p>
      And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for
      the Lord bath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
      And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi
      answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee
      to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.
    </p>
<p>
      And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and
      wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son
      Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
    </p>
<p>
      And it was told Joab, Behold the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.
      And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for
      the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son. And
      the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being
      ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
    </p>
<p>
      But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my
      son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!—2 Samuel xviii, 19 33; xix,
      1-4.

      And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he
      was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
      And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem;
      Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, Ibhar also, and Elishua,
      and Nepheg, and Japhia, and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.—2
      Samuel v. 13-16.
    </p>
<p>
      And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay

      loved him.—2 Samuel xii, 24.
    </p>
<p>
      So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. And
      the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years
      reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.

<p>
      Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was
      established greatly.—1 Kings ii, 10-12.
    </p>
<p>
      And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
      largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. And
      Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east
      country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all men; than
      Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol:
      and his fame was in all nations round about. And he spake three thousand
      proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees,
      from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth
      out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping
      things, and of fishes. And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of
      Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.—2

      Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood
      before him.
    </p>
<p>
      And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house;
      and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. And it came to pass
      the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered
      also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house,
      save we two in the house. And this woman's child died in the night;
      because she overlaid it. And she arose at midnight, and took my son from
      beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid
      her dead child in my bosom. And when I rose in the morning to give my
      child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the
      morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
    </p>
<p>
      And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is
      thy son.
    </p>
<p>
      And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and, the living is my son.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus they spake before the king.
    </p>
<p>
      Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son
      is the dead—and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and
      my son is the living. And the king said, Bring me a sword.
    </p>
<p>
      And they brought a sword before the king.
    </p>
<p>
      And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the
      one, and half to the other.
    </p>
<p>
      Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her
      bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living
      child, and in no wise slay it.
    </p>
<p>
      But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise
      slay it she is the mother thereof.
    </p>
<p>
      And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they
      feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do
      judgment. 1 Kings iii, 16-28.

      And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard
      that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was
      ever a lover of David.
    </p>
<p>
      And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, Thou knowest how that David my father
      could not build a house unto the name of the Lord his God for the wars
      which were about him on every side, until the Lord put them under the
      soles of his feet. But now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every
      side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent. And, behold:
      I purpose to build a house unto the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord
      spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy
      throne in thy room, he shall build a house unto my name. Now therefore
      command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants
      shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for the
      servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that
      there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the
      Sidonians.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he
      rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, which hath given
      unto David a wise son over this great, people. And Hiram sent to Solomon,
      saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I
      will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber
      of fir: My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea; and I
      will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint
      me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive
      them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my
      household.
    </p>
<p>
      So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his
      desire.
    </p>
<p>
      And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his
      household and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year
      by year.
    </p>
<p>
      And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace
      between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
    </p>
<p>
      And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty
      thousand men. And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by
      courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and
      Adoniram was over the levy. And Solomon had three score and ten thousand
      that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains beside
      the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand
      and three-hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
      And the king commanded and they brought great stones, costly stones, and
      hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the' house. And Solomon's builders,
      and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone-squarers; so they
      prepared timber and stones to build the house.—1 Kings v.

      Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him
      all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words
      which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.
      And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen
      what way the man of God went, which came, from Judah. And he said unto his
      sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the, ass: and he rode
      thereon, and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an
      oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?
      And he said, I am. Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat
      bread. And he, said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
      neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: for it
      was said to me by the word of the Lord, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink
      water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest. He said
      unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by
      the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house,
      that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him. So he went
      back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the Lord
      came unto the prophet that brought him back: and he cried unto the man of
      God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou
      hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment
      which the Lord thy God commanded thee, but camest back, and hast eaten
      bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to thee,
      Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcass shall not come unto the
      sepulchre of thy fathers.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk,
      that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had
      brought back.
    </p>
<p>
      And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his
      carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood
      by the carcass.
    </p>
<p>
      And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the
      lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told it in the city where
      the old prophet dwelt. And when the prophet that brought him back from the
      way heard thereof, he said, It is; the man of God, who was disobedient
      unto the word of the Lord: therefore the Lord hath delivered him unto the
      lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the
      Lord, which he spake unto him. And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me
      the ass. And they saddled him.
    </p>
<p>
      And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the
      lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn
      the ass.—2 Kings xiii, II-28.

      unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Is it not because there is not a God in
      Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
      therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone
      up, but shalt surely die. And he said unto them, What manner of man was he
      which came up to meet you, and told you these words? And they answered
      him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his
      loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went
      up to him and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto
      him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down. And Elijah answered
      and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come
      down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire
      from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
    </p>
<p>
      Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And
      he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come
      down quickly. And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of
      God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And
      the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
    </p>
<p>
      And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the
      third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before
      Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee,
      let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy
      sight. Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two
      captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life
      now be precious in thy sight.
    </p>
<p>
      And the angel of the lord said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not
      afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king. And he
      said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers
      to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no
      God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down
      off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
    </p>
<p>
      So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had spoken.—2
      Kings i, 2-17.

      And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a
      whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. And Elijah said unto
      Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord hath sent me to Beth-el. And
      Elisha said unto him, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will
      not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.

      to Jordan. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will
      not leave thee. And they two went on.

<p>
      And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off
      and they two stood by Jordan.
    </p>
<p>
      And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters,
      and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on
      dry ground.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto
      Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.
      And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon
      me. And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see
      me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it

      they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of

      So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
    </p>
<p>
      And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of
      wine What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and
      what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the
      kingdom.
    </p>
<p>
      Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy
      sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my
      petition, and my people at my request: for we are sold, I and my people,
      to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for
      bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue although the enemy could not
      countervail the king's damage.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is
      he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?
    </p>
<p>
      And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, Haman was afraid before the king and the queen. And the king arising
      from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and
      Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he
      saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the
      banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was.
      Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house?
    </p>
<p>
      As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. And
      Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the
      gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had
      spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king
      said, Hang him thereon.

      So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.

      Isaiah (in Hebrew, Yeshayahu, "Salvation of God"), the earliest and most
      sublime of the four greater Hebrew prophets, was the son of Amoz (2 Kings
      xix, 2-20; Isaiah xxxvii, 2), and he uttered his oracles during the reigns
      of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. The dates of his
      birth and death are unknown, but he lived from about 760 B.C. to about 700
      B.C. He was married and had three sons—the children referred to in
      Isaiah viii, 18; and he appears to have resided near Jerusalem.
    </p>
<p>
      But by most competent critics it is now held that the last twenty-seven
      chapters (40-66) of the book bearing his name were the work, not of the
      prophet, but of a later writer who is commonly styled the second or
      Deutero-Isaiah. In this portion of the book, Cyrus, who was not born till
      after 600 B.C., is mentioned by name (Isaiah, xliv, 28; xlv, i); and
      events which did not take place till a century after the prophet's death
      are referred to as happening contemporaneously with the writer's account
      of them. The style of these last twenty-seven chapters, also, is
      different, and the tone is more elevated and spiritual.
    </p>
<p>
      Dore's ideal portrait is more suited to the second or pseudo-Isaiah, than

      Ezekiel, the third of the great Hebrew prophets, was the son of the priest
      Buzi. (Ezekiel i, 3). He was probably born about 620 or 630 years before
      Christ, and was consequently a contemporary of Jeremiah and Daniel, to the
      latter of whom he alludes in chapters xiv, 14-20 and xxviii, 3. When
      Jerusalem was taken by Nebuchadnezzar in 597 B.C. (2 Kings xxiv, 8-16;
      Jeremiah xxix, 1-2; Ezekiel xvii, 12; xix, 9), Ezekiel was carried captive
      along with Jehoiachin, or Jeconiah, king of Judah, and thousands of other
      Jewish prisoners, to Babylonia, or as he himself calls it, "the land of
      the Chaldeans." (Ezekiel i, 3). Here, along with his exiled
      fellow-countrymen, he lived on the banks of the river Chebar (Ezekiel i,
      1-3), in a house of his own (viii, i). Here also he married, and here,
      too, his wife, "the desire of his eyes," was taken from him "with a
      stroke" (Ezekiel xxiv, 15-18). His prophetic career extended over
      twenty-two years, from about 592 B.C. to about 570 B.C.
    </p>
<p>
      The book bearing his name is written in a mystical and symbolical style,
      and abounds with visions and difficult allegories which indicate on the
      part of the author the possession of a vivid and sublime imagination.
      Ezekiel's authorship of it has been questioned. The Talmud attributes it
      to the Great Synagogue, of which Ezekiel was not a member. It is divisible
      into two portions. The first (chapters i-xxiv) was written before, and the
      second (chapters xxv-xlviii) after, the destruction of Jerusalem by
      Nebuchadnezzar in 586 B.C, the eleventh year of the prophet's captivity
      (Ezekiel xxvi, 1-2; XI, i). The present text is very imperfect, being
      corrupted by the interpolation of glosses and other additions by later
      hands.
    </p>
<p>
      Dore's picture represents the prophet uttering his oracles to his
      fellow-exiles ("them of the captivity"), or to the "elders of Judah," or
      "elders of Israel," on one of the occasions to which he himself alludes
      (viii, I; xi, 25; xiv, I; xx, I).

      The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the Spirit of the
      Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones,
      and caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very
      many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.
    </p>
<p>
      And he said unto me; Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O
      Lord God, thou knowest.
    </p>
<p>
      Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye
      dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God unto these
      bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:
      And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and
      cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live and ye shall

      So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a
      noise, and behold a shaking, and the, bones came together, bone to his
      bone. And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them,
      and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.
    </p>
<p>
      Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and
      say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God; Come from the four winds, O
      breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.
    </p>
<p>
      So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and
      they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of
      Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we
      are cut off for our parts. Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus
      saith the Lord God; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and
      cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of
      Israel. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your
      graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, and shall put
      my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own
      land: then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it,

      Respecting the parentage or family of Daniel, the fourth of the great
      Hebrew prophets, nothing is known, though he appears to have been of noble
      if not of royal descent (Daniel i, 3). When, in the third year of the
      reign of King Jehoiakim (607, 606, 605, or 604 B.C.), Jerusalem was first
      taken by Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel, then a youth, was among the captives
      carried to Babylon. By the king's orders, he, with others of the Jewish
      youth, was educated for three years (Daniel i, 3-7). At this time Daniel
      acquired the power of interpreting dreams (i, 17), which he used with such
      advantage in expounding a dream of Nebuchadnezzar, that he was made ruler
      over the whole province of Babylon (Daniel ii, 46-48). Daniel's
      interpretation of Belshazzar's famous vision having been fulfilled by the
      capture of Babylon by Darius, that conqueror promoted Daniel to the
      highest office in the kingdom (Daniel vi, 1-3). The prophet also prospered
      greatly during the reign of Cyrus (Daniel vi, 28).
    </p>
<p>
      The book of Daniel is written partly in Chaldaic or Syriac (the vernacular
      Aramaic language spoken by the people of Palestine), and partly in sacred
      Hebrew. It is manifestly divisible into two portions. The first (chapters
      i-vi) narrating the details of the prophet's life, and the second
      (chapters vii-xii) setting forth his apocalyptic visions. Much doubt has
      been cast upon the authenticity of the work. The evident reference in the
      eleventh chapter to the conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great, which

      flourished, has led many modern critics to believe that the work was
      composed in the time of the Maccabees.

      Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.
      They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live forever.
      There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province
      of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not
      regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which
      thou hast set up.
    </p>
<p>
      Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach,
      Meshach, and Abed-nego. Then they brought these men before the king.
    </p>
<p>
      Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach,
      and Abed-nego? do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which
      I have set up? Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of
      the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of
      music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if
      ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning
      fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?
    </p>
<p>
      Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O
      Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be
      so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
      furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be
      it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship
      the golden image which thou hast set up.
    </p>
<p>
      Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was
      changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and
      commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it
      was wont to be heated. And he commanded the most mighty men that were in
      his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into
      the burning fiery furnace.
    </p>
<p>
      Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and
      their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery
      furnace. Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the
      furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up
      Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach,
      and Abed-nego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
    </p>
<p>
      Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and
      spake, and said unto his counselors, Did not we cast three men bound into
      the midst of the fire? They answered, and said unto the king, True, O
      king.
    </p>
<p>
      He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of
      the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the
      Son of God.
    </p>
<p>
      Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace,
      and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the
      most high God, come forth and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and
      Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire. And the princes,
      governors, and captains, and the king's counselors, being gathered
      together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was
      a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the
      smell of fire had passed on them.—Daniel iii, 8, 9, 12-27.

<p>
      Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and
      drank wine before the thousand. Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine,
      commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father
      Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that
      the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink
      therein. Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the
      temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his
      princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. They drank wine and
      praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and
      of stone.
    </p>
<p>
      In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over
      against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's
      palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. Then the king's
      countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints
      of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.
    </p>
<p>
      [On the failure of his astrologers and soothsayers to interpret the
      writing, the king, at the suggestion of his queen, sends for Daniel, who
      interprets it as follows:]
    </p>
<p>
      O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom,
      and majesty, and glory, and honor: and for the majesty that he gave him,
      all peoples, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom
      he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he
      set up; and whom he would he put down. But when his heart was lifted up,
      and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and
      they took his glory from him and he was driven from the sons of men; and
      his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild
      asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the
      dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of
      men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.
    </p>
<p>
      And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou
      knewest all this; but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven;
      and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and
      thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and
      thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and
      stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy
      breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.
    </p>
<p>
      Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.
    </p>
<p>
      And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
      This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy
      kingdom and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art
      found wanting. PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
      Persians.
    </p>
<p>
      In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And Darius
      the Median took the kingdom.—Daniel v.

</p>
<p>
      Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house;
      and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled
      upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his
      God, as he did aforetime.
    </p>
<p>
      Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication
      before his God. Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning
      the king's decree Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall
      ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king,
      shall be cast into the den of lions.
    </p>
<p>
      The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the
      Medes and Persians, which altereth not.
    </p>
<p>
      Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the
      children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the
      decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with
      himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till
      the going down of the sun to deliver him.
    </p>
<p>
      Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O
      king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor
      statute which the king establisheth may be changed. Then the king
      commanded, and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions. Now
      the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest
      continually, he will deliver thee. And a stone was brought, and laid upon
      the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with
      the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning
      Daniel.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither
      were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from
      him. Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto
      the den of lions. And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable
      voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel,
      servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able
      to deliver thee from the lions?
    </p>
<p>
      Then said Daniel unto the King, O king, live forever. My God hath sent his
      angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me:
      forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O
      king, have I done no hurt.
    </p>
<p>
      Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should
      take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and
      no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God. And
      the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel,
      and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their
      wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in
      pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.—Daniel vi,

      Amos, one of the earliest of the Hebrew prophets, flourished during the
      reign of Uzziah, about 790 B.C., and was consequently a contemporary of
      Hosea and Joel. In his youth he lived at Tekoa, about six miles south of
      Bethlehem, in Judaea, and was a herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit
      (Amos i, i; vii, 14). This occupation he gave up for that of prophet (vii,
      15), and he came forward to denounce the idolatry then prevalent in Judah,
      Israel, and the surrounding kingdoms.
    </p>
<p>
      The first six chapters of his book contain his denunciations of idolatry;
      the other three, his symbolical vision of the overthrow of the people of
      Israel, and a promise of their restoration. The style is remarkable for
      clearness and strength, and for its picturesque use of images drawn from
      the rural and pastoral life which the prophet had led in his youth.

      And the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time, saying, Arise,
      go unto to Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that
      I bid thee.
    </p>
<p>
      So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord.
      Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey. And Jonah
      began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet
      forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
    </p>
<p>
      So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on
      sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. For word
      came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid
      his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And
      he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree
      of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor
      flock taste anything: let them not feed, nor drink water: but let man and
      beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them
      turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their
      hands. Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his
      fierce anger, that we perish not?
    </p>
<p>
      And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God
      repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he

<p>
      Now the Babylonians had an idol called Bel: and there were spent upon him
      every day, twelve great measures of fine flour, and forty sheep, and sixty
      vessels of wine. The king also worshipped him, and went every day to adore
      him: but Daniel adored his God. And the king said unto him: Why dost thou
      not adore Bel? And he answered, and said to him Because I do not worship
      idols made with hands, but the living God, that created heaven and earth,
      and hath power over all flesh. And the king said to him: Doth not Bel seem
      to thee to be a living God? Seest thou not how much he eateth and drinketh
      every day? Then Daniel smiled and said: O king, be not deceived: for this
      is but clay within, and brass without, neither hath he eaten at any time.
    </p>
<p>
      And the king being angry called for his priests, and said to them: If you
      tell me not, who it is that eateth up these expenses, you shall die. But
      if you can show that Bel eateth these things, Daniel shall die, because he
      hath blasphemed against Bel.
    </p>
<p>
      And Daniel said to the king: Be it done according to thy word.
    </p>
<p>
      Now the priests of Bel were seventy besides their wives and little ones
      and children. And they went with Daniel into the temple of Bel. And the
      priests of Bel said: Behold, we go out: and do thou, O king, set on the
      meats, and make ready, the wine, and shut the door fast, and seal it with
      thy own ring: and when thou comest in the morning, if thou findest not
      that Bel hath eaten all up, we will suffer death, or else Daniel that hath
      lied against us.
    </p>
<p>
      And they little regarded it, because they had made under the table a
      secret entrance, and they always came in by it, and consumed those things.
    </p>
<p>
      So it came to pass after they were gone out, the king set the meats before
      Bel: and Daniel commanded his servants, and they brought ashes, and he
      sifted them all over the temple before the king: and going forth they shut
      the door, and having sealed it with the king's ring, they departed.
    </p>
<p>
      But the priests went in by night, according to their custom, with their
      wives and their children: and they eat and drank all up.
    </p>
<p>
      And the king rose early in the morning, and Daniel with him. And the king
      said: Are the seals whole, Daniel? and he answered: They are whole, O
      king. And as soon as he had opened the door, the king looked upon the
      table, and cried out with a loud voice Great art thou, O Bel, and there is
      not any deceit with thee. And Daniel laughed: and he held the king that he
      should not go in: and he said: Behold the pavement, mark whose footsteps
      these are. And the king said: I see the footsteps of men, and women, and
      children. And the king was angry. Then he took the priests, and their
      wives, and their children: and they showed him the private doors by which
      they came in, and consumed the things that were on the table.
    </p>
<p>
      The king therefore put them to death, and delivered Bel into the power of
      Daniel: who destroyed him, and his temple.—Daniel xiv, I-21 (Douay

      But Heliodorus executed that which he had resolved on, himself being
      present in the same place with his guard about the treasury.
    </p>
<p>
      But the spirit of the Almighty God gave a great evidence of his presence,
      so that all that had presumed to obey him, falling down by the power of
      God, were struck with fainting and dread. For there appeared to them a
      horse with a terrible rider upon him, adorned with a very rich covering:
      and he ran fiercely and struck Heliodorus with his fore-feet, and he that
      sat upon him seemed to have armor of gold. Moreover, there appeared two
      other young men, beautiful and strong, bright and glorious, and in comely
      apparel: who stood by him, on either side, and scourged him without
      ceasing with many stripes.

<p>
      And Heliodorus suddenly fell to the ground, and they took him up covered
      with great darkness, and having put him into a litter they carried him
      out. So he that came with many servants, and all his guard into the
      aforesaid treasury, was carried out, no one being able to help him, the
      manifest power of God being known. And he indeed by the power of God lay
      speechless, and without all hope of recovery.—2 Maccabees iii,

      And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from
      Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. (And this taxing was
      first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) And all went to be taxed,
      every one into his own city.

<p>
      And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into
      Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was
      of the house and lineage of David:) to be taxed with Mary, his espoused
      wife, being great with child. And so it was, that, while they were there,
      the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought
      forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid
      him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.
    </p>
<p>
      And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping
      watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon
      them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore
      afraid: And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you
      good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is
      born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.
      And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in
      swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the
      angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to
      God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven,
      the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and
      see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto
      us. And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe
      lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the
      saying which was told them concerning this child. And all they that heard
      it, wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But
      Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. And the
      shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that
      they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.

      Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the
      king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying,
      Where is he that born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the
      east, and are come to worship him.
    </p>
<p>
      When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all
      Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and
      scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be
      born. And they said unto him; In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
      written by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem! in the land of Juda, are not
      the least among the princes of Juda: for out of the shall come a Governor,
      that shall rule my people Israel.
    </p>
<p>
      Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them
      diligently, what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem,
      and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have
      found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. When
      they had heard the king, they parted; and, lo, the star, which they saw in
      the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young
      child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.—Matthew

      And a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years, and had
      suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had,
      and was nothing bettered, but rather grew, worse, when she had heard of
      Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. For she said, If
      I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. And straightway the
      fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was
      healed of that plague. And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that
      virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who
      touched my clothes? And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the
      multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? And he looked
      round about to see her that had done this thing. But the woman fearing and
      trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him,
      and told him all the truth. And he said unto her Daughter, thy faith hath
      made the whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.

<p>
      While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house
      certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master
      any further? As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith
      unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe. And he
      suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother
      of James. And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and
      seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. And when he was
      come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is
      not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put
      them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them
      that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. And he
      took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is,
      being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise. And straightway the
      damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they
      were astonished with a great astonishment.

      down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the
      other side. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and
      looked on him, and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan,
      as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion
      on him. And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine,
      and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of
      him. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave
      them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou
      spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. Which now of these
      three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves?
    </p>
<p>
      And he said, He that shewed mercy on him.
    </p>
<p>
      Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.—Luke x, 29-37.

      Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of
      God over one sinner that repenteth.
    </p>
<p>
      And he said, a certain man had two sons: and the younger of them said to
      his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And
      he divided unto them his living.
    </p>
<p>
      And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took
      his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with
      riotous living. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in
      that land; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a
      citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
      And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did
      eat: and no man gave unto him.
    </p>
<p>
      And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my
      father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will
      arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned
      against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy
      son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
    </p>
<p>
      And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off,
      his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and
      kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against
      heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. But
      the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on
      him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: And bring hither
      the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this my
      son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they
      began to be merry.
    </p>
<p>
      Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the
      house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of the servants, and
      asked what these things meant.
    </p>
<p>
      And he said unto him, thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the
      fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.
    </p>
<p>
      And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and
      intreated him. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years
      do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and
      yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
      but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with
      harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
    </p>
<p>
      And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is
      thine. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy
      brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.—Luke

<p>
      There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen,
      and fared sumptuously every day:
    </p>
<p>
      And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate,
      full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the
      rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels
      into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell
      he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and
      Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on
      me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and
      cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
    </p>
<p>
      But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy
      good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted,
      and thou art tormented. And beside all this, between us and you there is a
      great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;
      neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him
      to my father's house: for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto
      them, lest they also come into this place of torment.

<p>
      Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear

<p>
      And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead,
      they will repent.

      will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.—Luke xvi,

      Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the
      parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was
      there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the
      well: and it was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to
      draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
    </p>
<p>
      (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
    </p>
<p>
      Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a
      Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no
      dealings with the Samaritans.
    </p>
<p>
      Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who
      it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of
      him, and he would have given thee living water.
    </p>
<p>
      The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the
      well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water? Art thou
      greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof
      himself, and his children, and his cattle?
    </p>
<p>
      Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall
      thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him
      shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a
      well of water springing up into everlasting life.
    </p>
<p>
      The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not,
      neither come hither to draw.
    </p>
<p>
      Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. The woman
      answered and said, I have no husband.
    </p>
<p>
      Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: for thou hast
      had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that
      saidst thou truly.
    </p>
<p>
      The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our
      fathers worshiped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the
      place where men ought to worship.
    </p>
<p>
      Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall
      neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye
      worship ye know not what: we know what we worship; for salvation is of the
      Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall
      worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to
      worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him
      in spirit and in truth.
    </p>
<p>
      The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called
      Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
    </p>
<p>
      Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
    </p>
<p>
      And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the
      woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
    </p>
<p>
      The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and
      saith to the men, Come, see a man, which told me all things, that ever I
      did: is not this the Christ? Then they went out of the city, and came unto
      him.—John iv 5-30

      Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. And early in the morning he came
      again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down,
      and taught them.
    </p>
<p>
      And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery;
      and when they had set her in the midst, they say unto him, Master, this
      woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses in the law
      commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? This they
      said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him.

<p>
      But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though
      he heard them not.

      So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto
      them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.

      And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

<p>
      And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out
      one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last; and Jesus was
      left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up
      himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman where are
      those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord.

      Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where
      Martha met him. The Jews then which were with her in the house, and
      comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out,
      followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. Then when
      Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet,
      saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
    </p>
<p>
      When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came
      with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, and said, Where have
      ye laid him?
    </p>
<p>
      They said unto him, Lord, come and see.

      Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! And some of them said, Could
      not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even
      this man should not have died?
    </p>
<p>
      Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a
      cave and a stone lay upon it. Jesus said, Take ye away the stone.

      Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this
      time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days.

      Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest
      believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
    </p>
<p>
      Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.
    </p>
<p>
      And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou
      hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
      people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent
      me.

      And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come

<p>
      Of Mary "called Magdalene" (Luke viii, 2) but few particulars are recorded
      in scripture. We first hear of her as having been delivered by Jesus of
      seven devils (Luke viii, 1-3; Mark xvi, 9). Impelled, no doubt, by
      gratitude for her deliverance, she becomes one of his followers,
      accompanying him thenceforward in all his wanderings faithfully till his
      death. She was the first person to whom he appeared after his resurrection
      (Mark xvi, 9; John xx, 1, 11-18) The common belief that she was a fallen
      woman is destitute of the slightest foundation. On the contrary, the
      references to her as being in the company of such women as Joanna, the
      wife of Herod's steward, Salome, the mother of James and John, and Mary,
      the mother of Jesus (Luke viii, 3; Mark xvi, 40; John xix, 25), strongly
      discountenance such a supposition. The error, which had no other source
      than ecclesiastical tradition, has been fostered and perpetuated by the
      stupid blunder of the translators of the authorized version in identifying
      her with the "sinner" who is described in Luke vii, 37-50 as washing the
      feet of Jesus with her tears (see head-note to Luke vii).
    </p>
<p>
      The Roman Catholic notion that this "sinner" was Mary the sister of
      Lazarus is almost equally groundless (see Douay Bible, head-note to
      Matthew xxvi, and the foot-note references to Luke vii, 37, found in most
      Catholic Bibles). The only reason for this identification is that the
      anointing by the "sinner" is described as taking place in the house of a
      Pharisee named Simon (Luke vii, 36, 39-40 43-44); that the anointing by
      the unnamed woman, as described in Matthew xxvi, 6-13 and Mark xiv, 3-9,
      took place in the house of one "Simon the leper," in Bethany; and that
      Mary, the sister of Lazarus, is described in John xi, 2, and xii, 3-8, as
      anointing Jesus in a house (apparently that of Lazarus himself) in
      Bethany, when a conversation ensues altogether different from that
      recorded in Luke vii, but similar to that related in Matthew xxvi, and
      Mark xiv, save that the objection to the anointing of Jesus is made, not
      by "his disciples" (Matthew xxvi, 8), not by "some that had indignation"
      (Mark xiv, 4), but by "one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son"
      (John xii, 4). The demeanor of Mary, the sister of Lazarus, is, however,
      by no means that of a fallen and sinful though penitent woman but that of
      a pious and good one (see Luke x, 39, 42; John xi, 28-33; xii, 3).
    </p>
<p>
      Dore's illustration, which portrays Mary Magdalene as a heartbroken and
      despairing sinner, shows that he has fallen into the common error.

      Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to
      Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat
      the passover? And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto
      him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy
      house with my disciples. And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed
      them; and they made ready the passover.
    </p>
<p>
      Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. And as they did
      eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
    </p>
<p>
      And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto
      him, Lord, is it I?

<p>
      And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish,

      but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good
      for that man if he had not been born. Then Judas, which betrayed him,
      answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.
    </p>
<p>
      And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it,
      and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he
      took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all
      of it; for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many
      for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth
      of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in
      my Father's kingdom.

      And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his

      them, Pray that ye enter not in temptation.

      Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith
      unto, the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. And he took
      with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and
      very heavy. Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
      unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
    </p>
<p>
      And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O
      my Father, if be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as
      I will, but as thou wilt.

<p>
      And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto

      weak.
    </p>
<p>
      He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if
      this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
    </p>
<p>
      And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.

<p>
      And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying
      the same words.

<p>
      And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and
      with him great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests
      and the scribes and the elders. And he that betrayed him had given them a
      token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and
      lead him away safely. And as soon as he was come, he goeth straight way to
      him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.

<p>
      And they laid their hands on him, and took him. And one of them that stood
      by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his
      ear. And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a
      thief, with swords and with staves to take me? I was daily with you in the
      temple teaching, and ye took me not but the scriptures must be fulfilled.

      CHRIST FAINTING UNDER THE CROSS.

      The incident depicted in this illustration seems to be as apocryphal as
      that embodied in the artist's picture of Mary Magdalene. There is
      absolutely no warrant in scripture for the notion that Christ fainted
      under the burden of the cross. The only foundation for such an idea to
      found in the Bible is contained in the head note to Mark xv, which is
      quite unwarranted by the text. According to the three synoptic gospels the
      cross was borne not by Christ, but by Simon, a Cyrenian (see Matthew
      xxvii, 32; Mark xv, 2 1; Luke xxiii, 26). According to the fourth
      evangelist, Jesus bore the cross without assistance the whole distance to
      the place crucifixion (John xix, 16-18). In not one of the four narratives
      is there so much as a hint that he fainted under the burden.

      And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a
      place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and
      when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. And they crucified him,
      and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which
      was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my
      vesture did they cast lots. And sitting down they watched him there; and
      set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE

      trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said,

      Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the
      ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
      saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why
      hast thou forsaken me?
    </p>
<p>
      Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man
      calleth for Elias. And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and
      filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. The
      rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.
    </p>
<p>
      Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
    </p>
<p>
      And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
      bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; and the graves were
      opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of
      the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and
      appeared unto many.
    </p>
<p>
      Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw
      the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly,
      saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

      And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from

      When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph,

      body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. And when
      Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid
      it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a
      great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.

      In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the

<p>
      And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord
      descended from, heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,
      and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white
      as snow: and for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead
      men.

<p>
      And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know
      that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here: for he is risen,

      And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus
      which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.
    </p>
<p>
      And they talked together of all these things which had happened. And it
      came to pass that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus
      himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they
      should not know him.
    </p>
<p>
      And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye
      have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
    </p>
<p>
      And the one of them, whose, name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art
      thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are
      come to pass there in these days?
    </p>
<p>
      And he said unto them, What things?
    </p>
<p>
      And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet
      mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: And how the chief
      priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have
      crucified him. But we trusted that it had been he which should have
      redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to-day is the third day since these
      things were done. Yea, and certain women also of our company made us
      astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; and when they found not his
      body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which
      said that he was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the
      sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw
      not.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the
      prophets have spoken: ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and
      to enter into his glory?
    </p>
<p>
      And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all
      the scriptures the things concerning himself.
    </p>
<p>
      And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as
      though he would have gone further. But they constrained him, saying, Abide
      with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went
      in to tarry with them.
    </p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and
      blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and
      they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
    </p>
<p>
      And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he
      talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?
    </p>
<p>
      And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the
      eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, saying, The Lord
      is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
    </p>
<p>
      And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of

      Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came
      unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and
      certain others with them. And they found the stone rolled away from the
      sepulchre.

      were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.

      saith unto them, Peace be unto you. * * *

      And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the

<p>
      And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and
      blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted
      from them, and carried up into heaven. And they worshiped him, and
      returned to Jerusalem with great joy. Luke xxiv, 1-2, 8-9, 13-14, 33-36,
      49-52.
    </p>
<p>
      The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began
      both to do and teach, until the day in which he was taken up, after that
      he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he
      had chosen: to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many
      infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the
      things pertaining to the kingdom of God: and, being assembled together
      with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but,
      wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.
      For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
      Ghost not many days hence.
    </p>
<p>
      When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord,
      wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom of Israel? And he said
      unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the
      Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that
      the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in
      Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of
      the earth.
    </p>
<p>
      And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up:
      and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked
      steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in

      words against this holy place, and the law: for we have heard him say,
      that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the
      customs which Moses delivered us.
    </p>
<p>
      And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face
      as it had been the face of an angel.
    </p>
<p>
      Then said the high priest, Are these things so?
    </p>
<p>
      And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken: [Stephen here makes his
      defense, concluding with a terrible, denunciation of the Jews as being
      stiffnecked and persecutors of their prophets, and as betrayers and
      murderers of Jesus Christ.]
    </p>
<p>
      When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they,
      gnashed on him with their teeth.
    </p>
<p>
      But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven,
      and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, and
      said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the
      right hand of God.
    </p>
<p>
      Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran
      upon him with one accord, and cast him out of, the city, and stoned him:
      and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose
      name was Saul. And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord
      Jesus, receive my spirit.
    </p>
<p>
      And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin
      to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
    </p>
<p>
      And Saul was consenting unto his death.—Acts vi, 8-15; vii, 1-2,
      54-56; viii, 1.

<p>
      And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
      disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and desired of him
      letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way,
      whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
    </p>
<p>
      And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined
      round about him a light from heaven: and he fell to the earth, and heard a
      voice, saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said,
      Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it
      is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he trembling and
      astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said
      unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou
      must do.
    </p>
<p>
      And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice,
      but seeing no man.
    </p>
<p>
      And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no
      man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. And he
      was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
    </p>
<p>
      And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him
      said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.
    </p>
<p>
      And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called
      Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of
      Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, and hath seen in a vision a man named
      Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his
      sight. Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how
      much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: and here he hath
      authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name. But
      the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to
      bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:
      for I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.
    </p>
<p>
      And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his
      hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto
      thee in the way as thou camest, hash sent me, that thou mightest receive
      thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And immediately there fell
      from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and
      arose and was baptized. And when he had received meat, he was
      strengthened.
    </p>
<p>
      Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus. And
      straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of
      God.—Acts ix, 1-20.

      THE DELIVERANCE OF ST. PETER.

      Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex
      certain of the church. And he killed James the brother of John with the
      sword.
    </p>
<p>
      And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter
      also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) And when he had
      apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four
      quarternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him
      forth to the people.
    </p>
<p>
      Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of
      the church unto God for him.
    </p>
<p>
      And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was
      sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers
      before the door kept the prison. And, behold, the angel of the Lord came
      upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the
      side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off
      from his hands. And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy
      sandals: And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about
      thee, and follow me. And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that
      it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision. When
      they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate
      that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord and
      they went out and passed on through one street and forthwith the angel
      departed from him.
    </p>
<p>
      And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that
      the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of
      Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.—Acts
      xii, 1-11

      PAUL AT EPHESUS.

<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
      And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having
      passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus; and finding certain
      disciples, he said unto them, Have ye, received the Holy Ghost since ye
      believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether
      there be any Holy Ghost. And he, said unto them, Unto what then were ye
      baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John verily
      baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they
      should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ
      Jesus.
    </p>
<p>
      When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
      And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them;
      and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. And all the men were about
      twelve.
    </p>
<p>
      And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three
      months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.
    </p>
<p>
      But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that
      way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the
      disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. And this
      continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia
      heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
    </p>
<p>
      And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: so that from his
      body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases
      departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
    </p>
<p>
      Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over
      them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure
      you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. And there were seven sons of one Sceva,
      a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. And the evil spirit
      answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? And the
      man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and
      prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and
      wounded.
    </p>
<p>
      And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus;
      and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
      And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. Many
      of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and
      burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found
      it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
    </p>
<p>
      So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.—Acts xix, 1—20.

      PAUL MENACED BY THE JEWS.

<p>
      Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow
      on them; them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with
      them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things,
      whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou
      thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.
    </p>
<p>
      Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them
      entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of
      purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia,
      when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands
      on him, crying out, Men of Israel, help: this is the man, that teacheth
      all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and
      further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy
      place. (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
      Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
    </p>
<p>
      And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took
      Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.
      And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of
      the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar: who immediately took
      soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them and when they saw the
      chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. Then the chief
      captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two
      chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done. And some cried one
      thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the
      certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
      And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the
      soldiers for the violence of the people. For the multitude of the people
      followed after, crying, Away with him.
    </p>
<p>
      And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain,
      May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek? Art not thou that
      Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into
      the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers? But Paul said, I am
      a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean
      city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.
    </p>
<p>
      And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned
      with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he
      spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue.—Acts xxi, 23-40.

<p>
      And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat,
      saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued
      fasting, having taken nothing. Wherefore I pray you to take some meat; for
      this is for your health: for there shall not a hair fall from the head of
      any of you.
    </p>
<p>
      And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in
      presence of them all; and when he had broken it, he began to eat. Then
      were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.
    </p>
<p>
      And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
    </p>
<p>
      And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the
      wheat into the sea. And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they
      discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded,
      if it were possible, to thrust in the ship. And when they had taken up the
      anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder
      bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore. And
      falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and
      the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but the hinder part was
      broken with the violence of the waves. And the soldiers' counsel was to
      kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape. But the
      centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and
      commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the
      sea, and get to land: and the rest, some on boards, and some on broken
      pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to
      land.
    </p>
<p>
      And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called
      Melita.
    </p>
<p>
      And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a
      fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because
      of the cold.—Acts xxvii, 33-44; xxviii, 1-2

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
